# File Recovery System

## Overview
The **File Recovery System** is a web-based application built using **Flask** that allows users to upload and manage files efficiently. It includes a distributed file system for storing uploaded files.

---

## Features
- User-friendly file upload and recovery system
- Built using **Flask** for backend
- Organized **Distributed File System** to manage uploaded files
- Debug mode available for easy development
- Supports **virtual environments** for dependency management
- Provides a clear directory structure for uploaded files

---

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python** (>=3.7)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Virtual Environment**
- **Flask**

## Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/Ankii04/File-Recovery-System.git
 cd File-Recovery-System
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Activate the Virtual Environment
Navigate to the **backend** directory and activate the virtual environment:
- **For macOS/Linux:**
  ```sh
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **For Windows (Command Prompt):**
  ```sh
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Flask installed:
```sh
pip install flask
```

---

## Running the Project

### ‚úÖ Start the Flask Server
Navigate to the **backend** directory and run:
```sh
flask --app backend.py run
```
To run in debug mode:
```sh
flask --app backend.py --debug run
```

---

## Upload File Location
All uploaded files are stored in:
```plaintext
File-Recovery-System/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ distributed-file-system/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/   # All uploaded files are saved here
```

### üìÇ File Upload Process
1. Navigate to the `distributed-file-system` directory.
2. Enter the `backend` folder.
3. Go to the `uploads` directory to view uploaded files.

   ```
3. To run in debug mode, use:
   ```sh
   flask --app backend.py --debug run
   ```

### Upload Files Location
1. Go to the `distributed-file-system` directory.
2. Navigate to the `backend` folder.
